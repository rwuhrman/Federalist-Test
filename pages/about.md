## About Unified Shared Services Management

Plain - USSM was stood up in October 2015 to oversee the current shared service ecosystem and provide a consistent long-term strategy for the expansion of administrative shared services. It serves as an integration body, collaborating across functions and the provider and customer landscapes to improve shared service delivery, increase agency adoption, and resolve concerns or disagreements between customers and providers.

USSM works in partnership with the shared services community to achieve the following:

### Vision

To enable the delivery of high-quality, high-value shared services that improve performance and efficiency throughout government.

### Mission

To create a shared services ecosystem that harmonizes good government, service consumer satisfaction, and service provider entrepreneurship and innovation.

### History

GSA was established by President Harry Truman on July 1, 1949, to streamline the administrative work of the federal government.  GSA consolidated the National Archives Establishment, the Federal Works Agency and its Public Buildings Administration, the Bureau of Federal Supply and the Office of Contract Settlement, and the War Assets Administration into one federal agency tasked with administering supplies and providing workplaces for federal employees
