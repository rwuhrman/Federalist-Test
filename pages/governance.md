## Governance Ecosystem
USSM was stood up in October 2015 to oversee the current shared service ecosystem and provide a consistent long-term strategy for the expansion of administrative shared services. It serves as an integration body, collaborating across functions and the provider and customer landscapes to improve shared service delivery, increase agency adoption, and resolve concerns or disagreements between customers and providers.

USSM works in partnership with the shared services community to achieve the following:

### Vision
To enable the delivery of high-quality, high-value shared services that improve performance and efficiency throughout government.

### Mission
To create a shared services ecosystem that harmonizes good government, service consumer satisfaction, and service provider entrepreneurship and innovation.

Five Strategic Goals
1. Improve shared services efficiency, economies of scale, marketplace health and sustainability.
 
2. Increase shared services adoptions and satisfaction among executive agencies.
 

3. Enable service providers to effectively deliver high-quality shared services.
 

4. Provide integrated, consistent, and sustainable management and oversight across shared service functions, the services made available by providers, and how agencies consume those services.
 

5. Enhance the agility of agencies to implement and adhere to current and future government-wide legislation and management reform initiatives.
