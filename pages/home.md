The Unified Shared Services Management (USSM) office, residing in the General Services Administration (GSA), Office of Government-wide Policy (OGP), is the integration body for shared services across the Federal government. The organization was chartered by the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) on October 22, 2015 and is responsible for managing the shared services ecosystem and collaborating across functions and the provider and customer landscapes to improve shared service delivery and increase agency adoption. The initial shared services focus areas for the USSM are financial management (FM), human resources (HR), acquisition, information technology (IT), and grants management. USSMâ€™s strategic direction is to drive shared services forward by establishing common standards and leveraging best practices in service delivery and performance.
